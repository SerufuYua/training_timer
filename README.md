This app is designed for tracking training time in various sports, from martial arts (boxing, MMA, etc.) to swimming and much more.

The app is designed for the Windows platform, becouse all similar apps are designed for mobile devices and nothing simple and usable for Windows.

A port to Android may be planned for the future.
